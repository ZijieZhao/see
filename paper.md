A MATLAB toolbox to detect and analyse marine heatwaves
==================================================================

As the increase of global temperature, frequent oceanic thermal extremes have been observed in various regions. With increased frequency 
and implication, marine heatwaves (MHWs), which have been defined as discrete prolonged anomalously warm water events, have received
more and more attention and focus. Previously, MHWs have been determined to
